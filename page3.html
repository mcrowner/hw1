      <h3>Summary</h3>
      <p class="text-justify">I am an MBA Candidate at the Kellogg School of Management where I am focusing my studies on Finance and Entrepreneurship. I am the co-president of the Hispanic Management Association.</p>
      <p class="text-justify">Prior to Kellogg, I was an analyst at the Cabrera Capital Companies. My key responsibilities included financial analysis, coordinating RFP submissions, assisting in fundraising strategy, consultant communications, and marketing. I was also deeply involved in the advocacy efforts undertaken at Cabrera including increasing Latino representation at the highest levels of government and providing better access to business opportunities with public entities for MBE's. I have assisted leaders across the country to advance these efforts.</p>
      <p class="text-justify">I received my Bachelor’s degree from Northwestern University where I majored in Economics and minored in Political Science and Business Institutions. I am a 2013 graduate of ICSC’s Real Estate Associate Program, an industry-backed, market driven program that seeks to train professionals in all facets of real estate. In 2014, I also completed the University of Southern California’s Ross Minority Program in Real Estate whose mission is to provide an executive education in real estate finance and development to professionals and entrepreneurs actively engaged in urban real estate and economic development activities. I am the winner of the program’s 2014 Best Development Proposal Award for my proposal for a currently vacant parcel in the West Adams neighborhood of the city of Los Angeles. The winning proposal was selected by a group of professors, professional developers, real estate experts, and community leaders. </p>
      <p class="text-justify">My professional securities licenses include: Series 7 and 63.</p>
